#   Routing Table


Look at your machine's routing table:

    pete@icebox:~$ sudo route -n

    Kernel IP routing table

    Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface

    0.0.0.0         192.168.224.2   0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0

    192.168.224.0   0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     1      0        0 eth0



### Destination

In the first field, we have a destination IP address of 192.168.224.0, this says that any packet that tries to go to this network, goes out through my Ethernet cable (eth0). If I was 192.168.224.5 and wanted to get to 192.168.224.7, I would just use the network interface eth0 directly.

Notice that we have addresses of 0.0.0.0 this means that no address is specified or it's unknown. So if for example, I wanted to send a packet to IP address 151.123.43.6, our routing table doesn't know where that goes, so it denotes it as 0.0.0.0 and therefore routes our packet to the Gateway.

### Gateway

If we are sending a packet that is not on the same network, it will be sent to this Gateway address. Which is aptly named as being a Gateway to another network.

### Genmask

This is the subnet mask, used to figure out what IP addresses match what destination.

### Flags

-   UG - Network is Up and is a Gateway
-   U - Network is Up


### Iface

This is the interface that our packet will be going out of, eth0 usually stands for the first Ethernet device on your system.
